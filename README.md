# movie-app
This mobile app is a project I’m working on to learn programming. The app lets users search for and explore movies, TV shows, and celebrities. You can watch trailers, read reviews, and see what’s trending. By using the TMDb API, the app pulls in information like movie posters, cast details, ratings, and summaries.
